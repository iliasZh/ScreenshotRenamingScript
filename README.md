# ScreenshotRenamingScript
PowerShell script for renaming my screenshots to the format I use

I have a folder named "My screenshots" on my PC which contains a bunch of other folders with TONS screenshots in them. I couldn't possibly rename them manually, so I wrote this script. To use it with your PC, change the $screenshotsFolder variable to your directory's location (don't forget the backslash at the end, it's mandatory), and it should work OK.
