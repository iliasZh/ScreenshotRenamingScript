# Screenshot renaming script
PowerShell script I use to rename my screenshots to my preferred format

I have a folder named "My screenshots" on my PC which contains a bunch of other folders with TONS screenshots in them. I couldn't possibly rename them manually, so I wrote this script. To use it with your PC, change the $screenshotsFolder variable to your directory's location (don't forget the backslash at the end, it's mandatory), and it should work OK.
